<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

Tickets have 3 stages that can be assigned to them. Assigned means that the ticket has been given to an Agent. Working the Issue(s) means that steps are being taken to reach a potencial resolution. Resolution means that a ticket was resolved or closed.

Now we will walk through the End-User expirence in creating a ticket to submit to the help desk.

The customer will recieve notifications letting them know that their request has been recieved.

When the Help Desk recieves the ticket, the priority will have to be set. The priority will be set and assigned to a particular Agent or Department.

We are going to set the priorty of the ticket we created for "entire mobile online banking is down", as "Emergency", since it is a Business impacting situation.

After connecting with the Sys Admin team, we will recieve a response letting us know the ticket is resolved.

Now that the ticket has been resolved, it will be reflected in the "closed" tickets column.
